        <h3 class="sub-title">Hello Teachers, Parents, and Musicians!</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
          We are excited to get started with the second year of Manitoba Strings
          Academy. Last year our first event, SpringFest, was incredibly well
          received with over 30 musicians participating in the recital class,
          recording sessions, and online masterclasses. This year we will expand
          SpringFest to include a wider range of grade levels and chamber
          groups.
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">SpringFest</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          SpringFest is a multi-part event that will allow Manitoba strings
          students to perform their repertoire in a concert venue. Performances
          will be video recorded using high quality equipment and shared with
          the musician and the clinician, to be used for feedback in the
          masterclass.
        </p>

        <u class="sub-name">Solo Performances</u>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Students in Groups A, B, & C will perform their selections
          consecutively (with a pianist if the work requires accompaniment). At
          a later date, groups of students will attend an online masterclass
          which will include individual and group feedback from the clinician.
        </p>

        <u class="sub-name">Chamber Performances</u>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Students will form their own chamber groups and perform polished
          chamber pieces. At a later date, chamber groups will attend an online
          masterclass which will include group feedback from the clinician.
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Clinicians</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Nationally acclaimed, non-local strings educators will be working with
          students to provide online adjudication.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          We're excited to announce that <b>Jonathan Crow</b> (violin) and
          <b>John Kadz</b>
          (cello) will be the Senior Clinicians!
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Location and Date</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          All SpringFest events will be held on
