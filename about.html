        <h3 class="sub-title">Vision</h3>

        <p class="list">
          To bring exceptional music education experiences to aspiring Manitoban
          string instrument players.
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Mission</h3>

        <p class="list">
          The Manitoba Strings Academy wants to provide young string students
          with first class professional training and performance opportunities
          with musicians locally, provincially, and nationally. We want to
          encourage students to engage with their peers and foster relationships
          with complimentary musical organizations that provide training and
          performance activities for individual and community musical growth.
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Core Values</h3>

        <ol class="list">
          <li>
            We believe that artistic expression, and specifically, music, and
            music education brings life changing benefits that go beyond musical
            endeavours to encourage emotional and intellectual growth.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            We believe that innovation in both teaching and participation, by
            implementing in-person, online, live and pre-recorded opportunities,
            is a powerful way to promote musical education.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            We believe that a supportive and diverse learning environment is the
            best way to nurture development among all participants.
          </li>
        </ol>
