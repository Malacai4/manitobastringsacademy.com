        <h1 class="page-title">SPRINGFEST RECITAL CLASS</h1>

        <p class="paragraph">
          SpringFest Recital Class is a one-day event on Saturday April 10th at
          St. Andrew's River Heights United Church, 255 Oak St. Winnipeg.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The recital class is open to students playing at all levels. Students
          are expected to perform 1-3 pieces for 10 mins. Students will perform
          their selections consecutively (with a collaborative pianist if the
          work requires accompaniment). This performance will be in a live
          recital format, with no adjudication, where parents are responsible
          for recording their own children.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          After registrations have been received, students will be notified of
          the exact date and time of their performance. Students will be
          expected to arrive at least 15 minutes before their assigned time.
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Audience</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Depending on COVID-19 protocols, there may be opportunity for a small
          live audience. All COVID-19 health & safety protocols will be strictly
          adhered to.
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Collaborative Pianists</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Due to COVID-19 restrictions and health considerations at the venue,
          the Manitoba Strings Academy has arranged for a collaborative pianist
          to accompany all performing students. Students will have 1 rehearsal
          (rehearsal time to be arranged by student) and 1 performance included
          in their fees.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The collaborative pianists will be Hannah Smith and Leanne Regehr-Lee.
