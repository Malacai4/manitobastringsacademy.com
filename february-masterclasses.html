          The Manitoba Strings Academy is excited to announce two masterclasses
          coming up in February. Some wonderful Canadian musicians are coming to
          Winnipeg so we are able to offer two in-person events to benefit from
          their expertise. Please add these dates to your calendar to hold the
          space. More information about each masterclass will be emailed soon.
